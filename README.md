# Project_Google_Advanced_Data_Analytic_Seoul_Bike_Rental_Maintenance_2018

## Scenario

In my current project as a data professional consulting for the Seoul transportation department, I'm tasked with analyzing the rented bicycle data from 2018. The director of the department has specifically requested insights into the best time of day for maintenance teams to repair bikes. The goal is to schedule maintenance during lower traffic times while adhering to standard working hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m).

To achieve this, I am utilizing Tableau to design a data visualization that effectively illustrates the low-traffic periods on standard workdays. The visualization will be instrumental in identifying optimal time slots for bike maintenance. Importantly, the director has specified the inclusion of gradients of orange to align with the company colors.

In the process of designing the visualization, my primary focus is on clarity, accessibility, and ethical considerations. The visualization should provide a clear representation of low-traffic times during standard work hours. I will use Tableau's features to filter and present the data in a visually appealing manner, making it accessible to stakeholders.

Additionally, I also created another visual that divide the bike rental by season to show what are the best low peak time of the day during different seasons to carry out maintenance.
